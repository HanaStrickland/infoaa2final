Notes,,,,,
The majority of our health coverage topics are based on analysis of the Census Bureauâ€™s March Supplement to the Current Population Survey (the CPS Annual Social and Economic Supplement or ASEC) by the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured. The CPS supplement is the primary source of annual health insurance coverage information in the United States.,,,,,
,,,,,
"In this analysis, income (mostly categorized as a percent of the federal poverty level) is aggregated by Census-defined family units. Analyzing income by family unit captures income available to a group of people who are likely sharing resources. However, family units may not be the appropriate measure for capturing eligibility for health insurance.  Eligibility for health insurance is more accurately estimated using ""health insurance units,"" which may be counted differently for different types of insurance (such as Medicaid or employer coverage).",,,,,
,,,,,
"The ASEC asks respondents about their health insurance coverage throughout the previous calendar year. Respondents may report having more than one type of coverage; however, individuals are sorted into only one category of insurance coverage. A person reporting having no source of coverage during the entire year would be categorized as Uninsured in this analysis.",,,,,

Definitions,,,,,
*Uninsured*: Includes those without health insurance and those who have coverage under the Indian Health Service only.,,,,,
,,,,,
Persons of Hispanic origin may be of any race; all other racial/ethnic groups are non-Hispanic. ,,,,,
,,,,,
"*Other:* Includes Asians, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders, American Indians, Aleutians, Eskimos and persons of ""Two or More Races"". These groups have been combined due to their small populations in many states which prevent meaningful statistical analyses of the groups individually.",,,,,
