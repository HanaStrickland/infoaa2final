Notes,,,,,
"The ASEC asks respondents about their health insurance coverage throughout the previous calendar year. Respondents may report having more than one type of coverage; however, individuals are sorted into only one category of insurance coverage. A person reporting having Medicare coverage and another type of coverage during the year would be categorized as having Medicare coverage in this analysis.",,,,,
